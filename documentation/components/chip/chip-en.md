## 1. What does the component do?
* It shows values and categories as compact elements.


## 2. When should the component be used?
* When it should be possible to assign several values to an attribute in a form.
* For filtering by categories.


## 3. Rules
* The term in the chip is always single-line (no line breaks) and the chip itself increases in width with the text.
* If a chip is too long for the viewport because of the text, the text is shortened with “…”.
* The input chips are shown in a [text field](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/webapps/components/textfiled). This can also be multi-line depending on the number of chips and available space.
* The chips in the textfield can be deleted by using backspace.
* The chips can be generated via ‘autocomplete’ selection or with free text depending on the use case.
