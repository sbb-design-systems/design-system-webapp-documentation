## 1. What does the component do? 
* It is used for the entry of larger quantities of text in forms.

* When the entry of longer text is required from the user.


## 3. Rules 
* The text area always has a label.
* A question mark in the circle can also be shown – in addition to the label – for detailed explanations. A [tooltip](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/webapps/components/tooltip) opens when this question mark is clicked on.
* The number of characters still available is shown bottom right (outside the text area is disabled).
* The basic height can be set when designing the form.
* If the text is longer than the basic height of the text area, the element increases in height with the content.
