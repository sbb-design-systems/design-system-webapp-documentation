## 1. What does the component do?
* It is used for the entry of yes/no values.


## 2. When should the component be used?
* When selecting an option.
* When selecting several options that are independent of one another.


## 3. Rules 
* A checkbox is only permitted within forms.
* Several checkboxes can be arranged vertically or horizontally. The vertical layout is preferred as it allows the user to understand the options more quickly.
* Horizontal layout only for two to three options and short names.
* The text can be multi-line.
* In addition to the actual checkbox, the entire text can also be used as a click target.
* A title can be used above a checkbox group.
* A question mark in the circle can be show – in addition to the title – for detailed explanations on a checkbox group. A [tooltip](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/webapps/components/tooltip) opens when this question mark is clicked on.
