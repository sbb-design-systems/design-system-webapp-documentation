## 1. What does the module do?
* It forms a bar where all actions of an application area are collected.


## 2. When should the module be used?
* When several actions can be performed in an application area.


## 3. Rules
* The button bar should always be placed at the bottom right of a container (e.g. form or dialog).
* The buttons are always placed to the right within the button bar.
* The primary action is placed to the left of the secondary actions.
* No more than three [Buttons](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/webapps/components/button) may be placed. If more actions are necessary, then a [Contextmenu](https://digital.sbb.ch/en/webapps/components/contextmenu) should be used. This is placed to the right of the other buttons.
